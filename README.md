# OmnigraffleFlexibleMagnets
An AppleScript script for easily distributing magnets around rectangles in OmniGraffle. Useful for creating IC circuit diagrams, logic diagrams, etc.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: This script was created for Omnigraffle Pro 5. I can't guarantee it will work with earlier or later versions without adaptation*

#How to use the script#
In Omnigraffle, select a rectangle before running the script. The script will ask you to select the number of magnets you want per side and whether to include the corners of th shape.

It will then ask you to select any combination of the four sides to apply the magnets to.
